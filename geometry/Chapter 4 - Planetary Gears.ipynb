Adding to this requirement, the teeth of each planet must mesh with both the sun and ring.  Determining valid conditions for teeth to mesh depends on the tooth counts, number of planets, and planet spacing.\n",

Next, add the first planet to a desired carrier position, rotating its teeth to mesh with the sun.  Then, position the ring at the origin, rotating its teeth to mesh with the planet.  Now, imagine adding the second planet somewhere on the carrier, not being allowed to rotate the sun or ring.  Only certain carrier positions will allow the second planet to mesh with both the sun and ring.\n",

    "It is also possible for the gears to mesh with *unequal planet spacing*.  In such cases, the smallest angular unit pertaining to the allowable planet positions is used to find the planet positions nearest equal spacing.  This unit angle of planet position, or so-called *tick angle*, may be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\theta} = \\frac{2 \\pi}{z_1 - z_3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, unuequal spacing is only used in 4-planet geartrains where the planet gears can be positioned with *diametrically-opposed* spacing.  Sometimes this is called an *X* configuration.  A diametrically-opposed design is allowed if the remainder of $k$ is 0.5.  Designs capable of being equally-spaced can also be modified to be diametrically-opposed."
