[Drivetrain Hub Notebook Series](https://drivetrainhub.com/code/notebooks) - learn, collaborate, and share knowledge in the field of drivetrain engineering with notebooks.  This repository is a collection of our notebooks on technical subjects specific to gears.

A notebook is an interactive code file with a human-friendly format, created with Markdown, HTML, and Python in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).  For helpful resources, such as contributing guidelines, our notebook template file, or learning about Markdown, Python, and Jupyter, see our [notebooks repo](https://github.com/drivetrainhub/notebooks).
